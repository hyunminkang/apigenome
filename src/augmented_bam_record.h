/**
 * The augmented BAM record adds functionalities to process the

 *
 * Augmented Cigar.
 *
 * The augmented cigar is basically a cigar that converts a normal
 * cigar to include mismatches.  An additional structure is added
 * to point to the releveant sequences.
 *
 * The goal is to simply allow a single iteration of the augmented
 * cigar for genotyping purposes.  In addition, this structure is
 * amenable to left alignment.
 *
 * Contains
 * 1. seq from bam1_t
 * 2. qual from bam1_t
 * 3. cigar from bam1_t
 * 4. MD from bam1_t (or reconstructed)
 * 5. aux_cigar that includes mismatches
 * 6. aux_seq that points to
 *    a. base substitution in MD
 *    b. inserted sequence in seq (I)
 *    c. deleted sequence in MD (D)
 *
 * For ease of left alignment of indels, and extracting a SNP
