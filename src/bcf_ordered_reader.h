/**
 * A class for reading ordered VCF/BCF files.
 *
 * Basically a record iterator that hides the
 * htslib interface from the programs in vt.
 *
 * The main impetus for this is that htslib
 * is currently incorporated as a very early
 * stage and is thus lacking many feature that
 * is useful to us at this point in time. This
 * allows us to isolate the changes required in
 * future to simply methods in hts_utils.
 *
 * The following cases are supported.
 *
 * 1) Input is an unindexed file which is not necessarily ordered.
 * 2) Input is an indexed file
 *
 * This class hides the handling of indices from
 * the user and also allows for the selection of
 * records in intervals in both cases 1 and 2.
